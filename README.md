#My Song Recognition

A minimal Shazam-like song recognition system built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and audio fingerprinting using STFT.

The application can:

Recognize songs in real time from a microphone

Index new songs into a database

Identify uploaded audio files

Provide a simple web interface

Overview

This project implements a simplified audio fingerprinting pipeline. It demonstrates how digital signal processing and database matching can be combined to build a basic music recognition system.

The system:

Extracts spectral features from audio using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

Detects spectral peaks per time frame.

Converts peak frequency indices into simple hashes.

Stores hashes with time offsets in PostgreSQL.

Matches incoming audio fingerprints against stored fingerprints using offset alignment.

##Architecture
###Fingerprint Generation

Audio is transformed using STFT (n_fft=2048).

For each time frame, peaks above 50% of the maximum magnitude are detected.

Each peak frequency index becomes a fingerprint hash.

Each fingerprint is stored as:

```python
(hash_value, time_offset)
```


This is a simplified approach compared to production-grade fingerprinting systems.

###Database Layer
Table Structure
```SQL
CREATE TABLE fingerprints (
    song_name TEXT,
    hash TEXT,
    time_offset INT
);
```


###Matching Strategy

Instead of performing thousands of individual SQL queries, the system performs a single query:

```SQL
SELECT song_name, time_offset, hash
FROM fingerprints
WHERE hash = ANY(:hashes);
```

All potential matches are fetched at once. Offset differences are then counted to determine the most consistent alignment, which identifies the best matching song.

An index on the hash column is required for performance:

```SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_hash ON fingerprints(hash);
```

###Microphone Recording

Sample rate: 44100 Hz

Mono

Float32 format

Chunk size: 1024

The /listen endpoint:

Records 1-second chunks

Builds a 5-second sliding window

Attempts recognition

Stops after 20 seconds (timeout)

API Endpoints
GET /

Returns a simple web interface with a microphone button.

GET /songs

Returns all indexed songs.

POST /index

Indexes a new uploaded song.

Parameters:

file: audio file

name: song name

Example response:
```JSON
{
  "status": "indexed",
  "fingerprints": 12345
}
```

POST /listen

Performs real-time recognition using the microphone.

Example response:
```JSON
{
  "detected_song": "Song Name",
  "score": 42,
  "confidence": 0.015
}
```



Confidence is calculated as:


```python
confidence = score / number_of_sample_fingerprints
```

POST /identify

Identifies an uploaded audio file using the same fingerprinting and matching pipeline.

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Required libraries include:

fastapi

uvicorn

librosa

numpy

scipy

pyaudio

sqlalchemy

psycopg2

3. Set Up PostgreSQL

Create database:
```cmd
createdb shazam
```

Create table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE fingerprints (
    song_name TEXT,
    hash TEXT,
    time_offset INT
);
```

Create index for performance:

```SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_hash ON fingerprints(hash);
```

4. Run the Application
```cmd
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

Open in your browser:
```HTTP
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Performance Improvements

The system originally suffered from request timeouts due to thousands of database queries executed in a loop.

This was resolved by:

Replacing per-hash queries with a single ANY() query

Adding a database index on hash

Using a sliding window for recognition

Adding silence detection before analysis

These changes significantly reduced latency and eliminated timeouts.

Limitations

This is a simplified fingerprinting implementation:

Hashes are based only on peak frequency index

No peak pairing

No time-delta hashing

Limited robustness to noise

Confidence score is heuristic, not probabilistic

Production systems use constellation maps, peak pairing, and noise-resistant hashing techniques.

Future Improvements

Implement peak pairing and time-delta hashing

Improve confidence scoring logic

Add background processing tasks

Improve UI/UX

Add containerization (Docker)

Add automated tests

Project Goals

This project demonstrates:

Digital signal processing fundamentals

Audio fingerprinting concepts

Efficient SQL-based matching

API design with FastAPI

Real-time audio handling

Backend performance optimization

It serves as an educational implementation of a simplified music recognition system.
